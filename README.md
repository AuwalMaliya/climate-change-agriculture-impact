# climate-change-agriculture-impact
This repository contains the analysis of the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity across multiple countries. It explores how climate variables such as temperature and rainfall affect crop yields, identifies resilient countries and crops, and evaluates key adaptation strategies to improve agricultural sustainability.
# Climate Change Impact on Agriculture

This project analyzes how climate change is influencing agricultural productivity across ten countries, using various crop types and adaptation strategies. It aims to provide data-driven insights into sustainable farming practices and policy guidance.

## 🌍 Objectives
- Explore the relationship between climate variables and crop yields
- Identify countries and crops with the highest resilience
- Highlight key adaptation strategies that influence productivity

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **Modeling & Analysis**
4. **Visualization of Insights**
5. **Reporting Key Findings**



## 📌 Key Findings
- Nigeria ranks highest in crop yield despite economic and climate challenges.
- Water management and drought resistance emerged as strong adaptation strategies.
- Climate variables such as temperature and rainfall patterns significantly influence yield.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
